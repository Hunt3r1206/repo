Description: This is Nova, a theme based on Lotus Dark. I made this through other themes such as Liaca Dark, Viola Dark, and Bohemic NOIR as well as creating my own icons for apps that were not covered between all of those. Mainly just editing the icons to fit in with the Lotus Dark theme or creating new ones. Firmware should be greater than 7.0
